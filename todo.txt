* Fix leapfrog
* Get parameters for WCSPH
* Optimal timestep calculation
* Surface tension
* Vorticity confinement
* Surface rendering -> narrow-band method
* Foam particles
* Fluid interaction
    -> Force with mouse pointer
    -> Pouring
    -> Oscillating wall (sine?)
* Boundary particles (active-flag?)
    -> Proper particle-struct (with striding?)
        -> Striding works with OpenGL?
* Particle size constant in world-space
* Surface meshing
